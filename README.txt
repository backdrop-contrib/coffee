The Coffee module helps you to navigate through the Drupal admin faster,
inspired by Alfred and Spotlight (OS X).

How to use it
Toggle Coffee using the keyboard shortcut alt + D
(alt + shift + D in Opera, alt + ctrl + D in Windows Internet Explorer).

Type the first few characters of the task that you want to perform. Coffee
will try to find the right result in as less characters as possible.
For example, if you want to go the the Appearance admin page, type ap and
just hit enter.

If your search query returns multiple results, you can use the arrow up/down
keys to choose the one you were looking for.

This will work for all Drupal admin pages.

In addition to that, there are several commands that you can use, listed below.

Commands
:add

Rapidly add content of a specific content type.

:help
View the Coffee module help page.

Hooks for developers
You can define your own actions in your module with hook_coffee_command(),
see coffee.api.php for further documentation.
