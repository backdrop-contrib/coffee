Coffee is a module that helps site administrator to navigate real fast through the admin pages.
When you hit alt+d a search box appears and you can type directly the page you'll looking for.

There is also the possibility to create your own list with the hook_coffee_action($op)
see API.txt for documentation. 

It is inspired by Alfred / Spotlight on OS X.

- alt + d: to open or close Coffee
- esc: close Coffee
- type directly the page you're looking for (path or title)
- hit enter to visit the first result
- navigate in the result list with arrow down and arrow up
- hit enter to visit that result
